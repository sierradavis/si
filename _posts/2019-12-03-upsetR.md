<p>I am going to take a look at safer parks 2017 data set from #TidyTuesday using an UpSet Plot. The dataset contains approximately 8,000 amusement ride accident reports from 28 state agencies and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. For this example, I will be looking at the accident cause based on Manufactures with high volume.</p>

[Safer Parks #TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-09-10)





<p>The UpSet technique visualizes set intersections on an aggregate basis.</p>  


[UpSetR]( https://github.com/hms-dbmi/UpSetR )

<p>I used the cause of the accident to determine the intersections. The vertical lines connect the cause of the accident. The unique number of accidents at the intersection is at the top of the bar chart. A light gray circle appears if a cause is not part of the intersection. The total number of accidents that have a specific cause is on the left-hand bar chart.</P>


```
library(tidyverse)
library(UpSetR)

manufacturer_data <- safer_parks %>% 
  group_by(manufacturer) %>% 
  summarize(Accidents = n_distinct(acc_id)) %>% 
  top_n(10)

manufacturer_data <- as.data.frame(manufacturer_data)

upset(manufacturer_data, sets = c("employee","op_error","mechanical"), 
sets.bar.color="#8FBC8F", order.by="freq", empty.intersections="on",set.size.show= FALSE)
```

<p>This is useful if we want to examine an intersection more in-depth. I can see what manufacturers generally have the same cause of accidents and what manufacturers only have one accident cause.</p>
