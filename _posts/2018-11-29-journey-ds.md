<p>Hi, my name is Sierra Davis and this is my journey to data science story. Early on in college, I knew I wanted to focus on using technology to help others. I obtained a role in medical informatics and was able to use SQL to create reports so that clinicians can make decisions on how to care for their patients. I transitioned to an exciting data scientist role in research after completing my masterâ€™s degree. In this role, I am able to use R to apply data science methods to solve meaningful pediatric research questions. As different research projects come along, I find it valuable to continue to increase my skills with independent learning. With the help of Coursera, edX and Dataquest, I am able to learn valuable methods to understand how to approach and solve various types of questions at my institution. Through data science, I am able to work with amazing researchers to help the future of pediatric care.</p>



<p>I still have much to learn but my goal is to continue to learn and become a mentor in my community. I also want to be a role model and advance the diversity in the R community. I hope my journey can inspire black women who also have an interest in data science! </p>
