<p>Starting a data science project in itself can be daunting. No matter how many times as data scientists go through a process, we still don't have all the answers. Data Science projects need a team effort to be successful. These teams comprise of subject matter experts to give us guidance along the way.</p>

Here are ways teamwork has helped me during a data science project:

1. Context is key

<p>We've all been there ready to send results after exploring data. But do we have the right context? For example, we analyze the number of medication orders at a facility. We then make an assumption that the surrounding population has a high usage of those medications. But, this particular facility distributes medications across the United States and so implying that the surrounding population receives these drugs would be incorrect. Having an expert on your project team who understands medication orders and their definitions can save time and effort.</p>

2. Data Interpretation

<p>Clinical data can be difficult to interpret alone. Reviewing data with a subject matter expert can help interpret findings. It can also guide a data scientist to the most valuable data specific to the project. Eliminating noise makes analysis better for informed decision making.</p>

3. Finding data elsewhere

<p>Working with a large data warehouse there may be data from many systems in various tables. A subject matter expert can break down those silos to help find valuable data.</p>



<p>I collaborate with researchers using Microsoft 365 tools. This process has been great and I am able to share visualizations and analysis in a collaborative way.</p>
