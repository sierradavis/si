<p>Quantiles distribute ordered data points into a group of equal-sized data groups. Quantile-Quantile plots allow you to visualize the two probability distributions by plotting their quantiles against each other.</p>

<p>In this example, we can analyze the normality of the mpg in mtcars.</p>

<p>As an another example, consider the data about absenteeism in the workplace.</p>

<p>Q-Q plots of the Age of the 36 employees. The plot has a stairstep pattern which indicates the data points are discrete. This validates our assumption on the distribution because age in years are typically whole numbers.</p>
